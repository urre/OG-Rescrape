# OG Rescrape

When you share a post/page on Facebook, it scrapes the url for the Open Graph Data to determine what image/video/content to display. Facebook caches to image for you so if you need to change it, the old image will still be displayed. Probably not what you want to do. You can manually go to the [](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and click "Fetch new scrape information", but this might be time consuming.
