Facebooks not clearing Open Graph cache for your post/page? 

== Description ==

When you share a post/page on Facebook, it scrapes the url for the Open Graph Data to determine what image/video/content to display. Facebook caches to image for you so if you need to change it, the old image will still be displayded. Probably not what you want to do.

This plugin programatically forces a rescrape.

You can also use the debugger forces Facebook to rescrape the URL, so that should bust the cache.
